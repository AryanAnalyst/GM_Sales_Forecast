# Global_Mart_Sales_Forecast
GM, an online supergiant store has worldwide operations. Store takes orders and delivers across the globe and deals with all the major product categories â€” consumer, corporate and home office.
I am going to forecast the sales of the products for the next 6 months, so that we have a proper estimate and can plan inventory and business processes accordingly.

# Some Findings after Reading the dataset
The store dataset has the 5 attributes - Order-Date, Segment, Market, Sales, Profit
The store caters to 7 different geographical market segments - Africa, APAC (Asia Pacific), Canada, EMEA(Middle East), EU (European Union), LATAM (Latin America), US (United States) and 3 major customer segments, i.e. consumer, corporate and home
Based on these, there are 21 unique "Market-Segments" for which the sales forecasts can be made. 
So, I am going to Calculate the CoV on the profit for each of the 21 market segments on the train data that will help in finding the most profitable market segment by comparing the 21 CoV values.
